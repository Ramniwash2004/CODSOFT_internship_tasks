                <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
                <p>
                    Bhagat Singh was born on September 28, 1907, in Banga village of Punjab Province in British India (now in Pakistan). 
                    His family had a long history of patriotism and resistance against British rule. From a young age, Bhagat Singh was inspired by the sacrifices of freedom fighters and was deeply disturbed by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919.

                    He attended National College in Lahore, where he was actively involved in political activities and writing for revolutionary publications.

                <p>
                    Bhagat Singh joined the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) and quickly became one of its most prominent members. 
                    In 1928, he planned the assassination of British officer James Scott to avenge Lala Lajpat Rai's death but mistakenly killed J.P. Saunders instead.

                    In 1929, Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt threw non-lethal bombs in the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi to protest oppressive laws. 
                    They were arrested, and Bhagat Singh used the trial as a platform to promote the cause of Indian independence.
                </p>
                <h2>Ideology and Legacy</h2>

                    Bhagat Singh was a firm believer in socialism, secularism, and equality. He believed that true freedom could only come through the end of exploitation, not just colonial rule. 
                    He read extensively‚Äîbooks on Karl Marx, Lenin, and Mikhail Bakunin influenced his thinking deeply.
                </p>
